                    <p><b>Summer 2014 - Research Assistant</b> I had just finished year 2 and had never built an actual application, I was afraid and envious of those who had, but just did not know how to start. I had good grades but I just felt like an imposter who would never be able to be a real software developer. When you brought me in that summer, you guided me along each step, giving me digestable tasks each a big larger than the previous, until finally I had built my first app. Initially, every morning the team met for 'scrum', it was Jarred, Inzamam and I. Jarred and Inzamam belonged to the year before me and were both exceptional, thinking back, the complexity of their problems must have been vastly superior to mine but you never made it seem that way. You always encouraged me and made me feel as if my work was meaningful and complex "the kyle speech". I remember dealing with appengine, at the time it was a toddler and I was a zygote, thank you for having the patience lol. It sounds so cliche and yet understated when I say, the time I spend under you really changed my life; I went from being afraid to attempt to anything to literally believing that everything was easy to build; My freetime went from doing nothing to excitedly prepping for a competition or learning some new thing; At the time my cirlce of friends started to change, either they joined in and started to grow or we drifted; I met some of my greatest (and brightest) friends there; I can't say it enough, the experience, you were life changing.</p>

                    <p><b>The many competitions</b> It's difficult to begin because I honestly don't know where to start. A good place would be my first, Code Jam, but even here, do I say thankyou for guiding the team during our software development, reviewing our ideas and designs, listening to our silly qualms, pulling us up if necessary. Or do I start months before during the summer when you had started consistently trying to convince me to participate. Maybe Agrihack ? The competition you told Jherez and I about, spent hours with us fleshing out an idea, then driving us to the competition because we had no idea where were going and how we would have gotten there otherwise. Or maybe guiding us while we were in Suriname for both. 
                    <br/><br/> On behalf of the team, thanks for helping us achieve more than we ever thought we could have done ourselves

                    <p><b>Life in general and random stuff</b> - Can I just say you two are a wealth of knowledge and patience, thanks for letting me interrupt you both so many times &#128557 to ask advice about studies, work, how-to-pg. <br/>- I am pretty laidback when it comes to everything else besides work, I gave myself an extremely small window of time to prepare things to go Japan for my conf, Vani thankyou for saving me &#128557, basically providing me a how-to guide on travel, and hotels, anddddd using your card to pay for my hotel. Fun fact btw, my first online purchases were with your card & account. Again also for those times, thank you for being so patient with me. You two made the dept feel welcoming, like a place I (and I suppose other students) could have returned to and be warmly met (The friendly banter will be missed sooooo much). I will miss you both.<br/><br/> </p>

                This seems kinda lame but when was the last time I wrote HTML? Maybe I should slip in some VBA for Vani O_o <br/><br/>
                It's not easy taking the time to listen to problems and provide wise counsel while having your own work (and lives) but you guys always did. You all never made it seem like a chore either. <br/>
                We'll definitely link soonish but once again thanks for everything!

				We officially old like the road now bai. I am happy to have been there at the start and now at the end with you. I deeply appreciate our time together, espically our summer projects. Jammers has been and will continue to be
				life changing for all of us. Guess its about time we start something new. Jammers international anyone???! You have been and will continue to be an inspiration to us all. The best thing about teaching is what you can learn from
				your students. After you have settled in (and finish PhD) lets start another journey together. All the best bro! We all love you guys very much!
