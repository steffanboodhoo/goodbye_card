                    <p><b>Summer 2014 - Research Assistant</b> I had just finished year 2 and had never built an actual
                        application, I was afraid and envious of those who had, but just did not know how to start. I
                        had good grades but I just felt like an imposter who would never be able to be a real software
                        developer. When you brought me in that summer, you guided me along each step, giving me
                        digestable tasks each a big larger than the previous, until finally I had built my first app.
                        Initially, every morning the team met for 'scrum', it was Jarred, Inzamam and I. Jarred and
                        Inzamam belonged to the year before me and were both exceptional, thinking back, the complexity
                        of their problems must have been vastly superior to mine but you never made it seem that way.
                        You always encouraged me and made me feel as if my work was meaningful and complex "the kyle
                        speech". I remember dealing with appengine, at the time it was a toddler and I was a zygote,
                        thank you for having the patience lol. It sounds so cliche and yet understated when I say, the
                        time I spend under you really changed my life; I went from being afraid to attempt to anything
                        to literally believing that everything was easy to build; My freetime went from doing nothing to
                        excitedly prepping for a competition or learning some new thing; At the time my cirlce of
                        friends started to change, either they joined in and started to grow or we drifted; I met some
                        of my greatest (and brightest) friends there; I can't say it enough, the experience, you were
                        life changing.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card card-body">
                    <p><b>The many competitions</b> It's difficult to begin because I honestly don't know where to
                        start. A good place would be my first, Code Jam, but even here, do I say thankyou for guiding
                        the team during our software development, reviewing our ideas and designs, listening to our
                        silly qualms, pulling us up if necessary. Or do I start months before during the summer when you
                        had started consistently trying to convince me to participate. Maybe Agrihack ? The competition
                        you told Jherez and I about, spent hours with us fleshing out an idea, then driving us to the
                        competition because we had no idea where were going and how we would have gotten there
                        otherwise. Or maybe guiding us while we were in Suriname for both.
                        <br /><br /> On behalf of the team, thanks for helping us achieve more than we ever thought we
                        could have done ourselves

                We officially old like the road now bai. I am happy to have been there at the start and now at the end
                with you. I deeply appreciate our time together, espically our summer projects. Jammers has been and
                will continue to be
                life changing for all of us. Guess its about time we start something new. Jammers international
                anyone???! You have been and will continue to be an inspiration to us all. The best thing about teaching
                is what you can learn from
                your students. After you have settled in (and finish PhD) lets start another journey together. All the
                best bro! We all love you guys very much!

                I do not think I have ever told you this, but you have significantly influenced the way I present/teach.
                I always think about how passionate you are when you talk about all of the things you've worked on and
                how lucrative or fun you make any opportunity sound.
                The way in which you hype a crowd with your articulate expressions is something I always admire. I look
                forward to the next time you use this ability to tell the Trinidad branch of the Jammers of your journey
                as a senior software eng in a foreign land.
                I hope to see all the pics of all the pups you adopt and take on hikes in Canada!

                And imagine I was gonna go to UWI Mona? Maybe I would have met a Kyle there, who knows? Anyway I'm
                really grateful
                for these years where I got to know you, first as a lecturer and then on a more personal level. I still
                remember
                the first time I got invited into that secret backroom, I felt like I had arrived. For me, it was when
                you extended that
                first offer for the AgriNet summer internship in 2014, that
                summer changed me. It opened up new possibilities for me, and it made forced a reevaluation what I could
                do. Most importantly,
                those interactions sent me down a path of participating in side projects, competitions where we
                represented the university
                (I'll never forget Suriname) and other nice things that I use to pad my resume to this day 😂.
                I've enjoyed our many talks, and your wise sayings, but the thing I appreciated most about you was your
                optimism and dedication,
                and your ability to inspire. Thank you for being a part of my life and I wish you nothing but blessings
                in your future moves.
                PS: the birds to come will be okay.

                Where do I start? I can’t begin to express in words how much both you guys have influenced and shaped me into not only the software developer I am today, but also, the person. You both have always been there for me, both academically and personally, whether it's to chat about some software architectural design or just to ole talk. I’m sad that you guys are leaving, however, we have a friendship that even if we don’t see each other for years, when we do, we can pick up right where we left off.

                        The incessant vagaries of academic life would have so much more difficult to weather if not for your friendship, kindness, and unwavering support. Without your mentorship and counsel, I would have not been able to grow and achieve as much as I have in the last 8 years; I’m pretty certain that I would have also blown myself up in the proverbial minefield of academia without it. Thanks to the experiences you facilitated during Agrinet, Jammers, and UWICS, I found my niches in research and teaching. How I teach, mentor, and support my students is predicated on how you taught, mentored, and supported me. I can only hope that one day I can asymptotically approach the same level of positive impact on other people’s lives as you have had on mine.
